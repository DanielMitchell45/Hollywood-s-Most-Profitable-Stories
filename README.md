# Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories

This project was to analyse the performance of Hollywood movies. The Dashboard's landing page was to display visuals for the: Movie Titles, The Genre, The Studio where the movie was made, the movie's profitability and ratings for movies released between 2007 & 2012.

The requirement for this project was to analyze the performance of the Hollywood movies that were from a dataset provided with 74 rows in total to reflect 74 Hollywood movies from 2007 to 2012.
 
The process to do this included uploading the dataset into R programming after it was downloaded from the Tableau Public location linked below: 

https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv

Actions were to perform an initial Exploratory Analysis, and then clean the data within R was carried out. Then another Exploratory Analysis was carried out afterwards to compare and show the changes the cleaning processes made.

The next steps were to then to export the cleaned data from R into PowerBi to create visuals that show a variety of statistics that can be seen at a glance from the cleaned data in a clear and meaningful way using specific colors that have been requested by the client.

The requested brand colors are blue, green, and brown. Options to use a variety of shades were offered.
 
The last request was that the Power BI Dashboard should show the following on the landing dashboard:
 
•	The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre
•	The number of movies produced per year 
•	The audience scores for each film  
•	The profitability per studio 
•	The worldwide gross per genre 

Here is a screenshot of the landing page:

Additional visuals were added on subsequent dashboards with a variety of interactivities so that any required information could be gathered at a glance

Here is a screenshot of 5 additional visuals with additional information that relay additional usefull information that the client at a glance can compare and present in an effecient meaningfull way:


 
My finding were that even though this dataset was cleaned thoroughly. I have carefully examined the dataset after this process, especially with regard to the two different ratings between the Tomatometer and the Audience score categories. I expected these two classifications to have a greater significant correlation than what it came out to be. 
I have since taken the time to manually examine the dataset itself as there were less than 80 rows in total for this dataset. 
Visually, there was a good correlation on most of the rows. However, I was expecting the review scores to be closer. 
I took it upon myself to examine the Rotten Tomatoes site in more detail to gather more information about the differences between these two ratings in question to try to gather an explanation as to why the correlation was not closer.
It was found that the Tomatometer panel are made up of critics who have to apply and meet several criterias before they would be able to contribute towards the Tomatometer score that is applied to a show. 
A Tomatometer critic needs to meet the following guidelines or rules:
Criticism can be many things: a deep dive into the filmmaking craft, an analysis of subtext, a discussion on social commentary, and an enthusiastic argument. They look for engaging content that has a distinct voice and offers perspective on a film or TV series, not just a plot summary.
They are to reflect and represent the moviegoing and TV-viewing audience with our Tomatometer-approved critic’s community. To cultivate a rich, varied, and inclusive space for engaging perspectives and debate, critics who reach a wide audience, but also those whose film and TV coverage serves underrepresented groups.
Reviews should observe grammatical rules and demonstrate clarity and structure, whether approved by an editorial staff or self-published. In the same vein, video, and podcast reviews should be well structured and have clear resolution and sound.
Whether they are podcasters producing multiple shows per month or an alt-weekly contributor, they recognize that there are varying degrees of output among critics. Contribution minimums are outlined in the eligibility guidelines, but they also look for overall consistency and demonstrated commitment to the field. Additionally, memberships in critics organizations are recognized as a sign of merit, but are not essential for – nor do they guarantee – inclusion.”
The above was quoted directly from the Rotten Tomatoes home pages.
To summarise, the findings have been fairly varied, in my humble opinion, this is possibly because of many things that are beyond the scope of this report.
If given the opportunity to, I would gladly investigate this matter in even more detail as I am fairly surprised at the results and also intrigued by the differences in comparison to IMDB.
